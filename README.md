How to Stop Computers Being Biased

This article discusses the problems that arise in machine learning algorithms and the potential biases they can hold. It was interesting to read how these algorithms that are being designed to help people can be inherintly biased becuase they are being created by humans who can hold any type of biases. People use these algorithms hoping to be helped and can sometimes received mixed results due to varying factors such as the data the algorithm is being fed.


I find it interesting that code can be biased based on who writes it. (crj267)
